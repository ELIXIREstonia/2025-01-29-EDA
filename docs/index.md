    Workshop: Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R

    Are you ready to unlock the potential of your data? This one-day workshop will introduce you to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)â€”an essential first step in any data analysis workflow. Designed for graduate-level learners without a computational background, this course will equip you with the foundational skills to summarize, visualize, and interpret data effectively.

    :fontawesome-solid-arrow-left: **Prerequisites**  
    To be able to follow this course, learners should:  
    &emsp;1. Bring your own laptop and install R and RStudio (see [Setup](#setup) for details).  
    &emsp;2. install 'tidyverse' package (in R: ```install.packages("tidyverse")```)  
    
    </br>
    
    :fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: **Learning Outcomes:**  
    By the end of the course, learners will be able to:  
    &emsp;- Define key concepts and principles of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and explain its importance in the data analysis workflow.  
    &emsp;- Identify and describe common types of data (numerical, categorical) and the appropriate statistical summaries and visualizations for each.  
    &emsp;- Generate basic descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) and visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatterplots, boxplots) using R.  
    &emsp;- Evaluate datasets for common issues, such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, and apply basic techniques to address these issues (e.g., imputation, normalization).  
    &emsp;- Interpret key results from visualizations and statistical summaries to recognize patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.  
    &emsp;- Propose appropriate next steps for deeper analysis or preprocessing based on findings during the exploratory data analysis process.
