# Practice: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this practice session, you will apply the concepts learned in the previous chapters to perform EDA on a sample dataset. You will need to download the prepared [Rmarkdown](https://github.com/ELIXIREstonia/2025-01-29-EDA/practice/notebook.Rmd) document and open it in RStudio.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Rmarkdown Document**: Click [here](https://github.com/ELIXIREstonia/2025-01-29-EDA/practice/notebook.Rmd) to download the Rmarkdown (.Rmd) file to your local machine.

2. **Download the Dataset**: Download the sample dataset from [here](https://github.com/ELIXIREstonia/2025-01-29-EDA/practice/data/)

3. **Open RStudio**: Launch RStudio on your computer.

4. **Open the Rmarkdown Document**: In RStudio, go to `File` > `Open File...` and select the downloaded .Rmd file.

5. **Install Required Packages**: Ensure you have the necessary packages installed. You can run the following code in your R console to install the `tidyverse` package if you haven't already:
   ```{r}
   install.packages("tidyverse")
   ```

6. **Run the Code Chunks**: Execute the code chunks in the Rmarkdown document by clicking the green play button (`Run Current Chunk`) at the top right of each code chunk or by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + C` (Windows) or `Cmd + Option + C` (Mac).

## Completing the Tasks

The Rmarkdown document contains a series of tasks that you need to complete. Each task is designed to help you practice different aspects of EDA, including data cleaning, initial exploration, detailed exploration, and visualization.

## Conclusion

Once you have completed the tasks, save your Rmarkdown. You can then share your work with others or use it as a reference for future projects.

By following these steps and completing the tasks, you will gain hands-on experience with EDA and reinforce the concepts covered in the workshop. Good luck!
