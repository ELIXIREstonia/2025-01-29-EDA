# The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis workflow. It involves examining the data to understand its main characteristics, uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses. This guide will help you understand where to start, the steps involved, and what to consider at each step.

## Document the Process

Document your findings and the steps you took during the EDA process:  
- **Summary Report**: Create a summary report of your findings, including visualizations and key statistics.  
- **Code Documentation**: Document the code used for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

Excellent medium for the code and documentation is R Markdown. It allows you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document - [See Rstudio R Markdown Guide](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for more information.

## Step 1: Understand the Data Context

Before diving into the data, it's essential to understand the context:  
- **Objective**: What is the goal of the analysis?  
- **Data Source**: Where does the data come from?  
- **Data Collection Method**: How was the data collected?  
- **Variables**: What are the variables in the dataset, and what do they represent?

## Step 2: Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of preparing the data for analysis. This step includes:  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and decide how to handle missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
  ```{r}
  # Identify missing values
  sum(is.na(data))
  
  # Remove rows with missing values
  data <- na.omit(data)
  ```
- **Removing Duplicates**: Check for and remove duplicate records.
  ```{r}
  # Remove duplicate rows
  data <- data[!duplicated(data), ]
  ```
- **Correcting Errors**: Identify and correct any errors or inconsistencies in the data.
  ```{r}
  # Example: Correcting a specific error
  data$variable[data$variable == "incorrect_value"] <- "correct_value"
  ```
- **Data Transformation**: Transform data types if necessary (e.g., converting strings to dates).
  ```{r}
  # Convert string to date
  data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
  ```

Sometimes, especially for data that has been collected manually, it would be more efficient to use a dedicated tool for data cleaning, such as OpenRefine. See our [OpenRefine training materials](https://zenodo.org/records/13832071)

## Step 3: Initial Data Exploration

Perform an initial exploration to get a sense of the data:  
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical variables.
  ```{r}
  # Summary statistics
  summary(data$variable)
  ```
- **Frequency Tables**: Create frequency tables for categorical variables.
  ```{r}
  # Frequency table
  table(data$category)
  ```
- **Visualizations**: Use basic visualizations (histograms, bar charts, boxplots) to understand the distribution of the data.
  ```{r}
  # Histogram
  ggplot(data, aes(x = variable)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
  
  # Bar chart
  ggplot(data, aes(x = category)) + geom_bar()
  
  # Boxplot
  ggplot(data, aes(y = variable)) + geom_boxplot()
  ```
- **Outliers**: Detect outliers and decide how to handle them.
  ```{r}
  # Boxplot to detect outliers
  ggplot(data, aes(y = variable)) + geom_boxplot()
  ```

## Step 4: Data Normalization

Normalization is the process of scaling numerical data to a standard range, typically [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This step is important when the data has different units or scales, which can affect the results of the analysis.

### When to Normalize

- When the data has different units or scales.  
- Before applying machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data (e.g., k-means clustering, principal component analysis).  
- Before applying statistical tests that assume normality or require standardized data.

### Common R Methods for Normalization

- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scales the data to a range of [0, 1].
  ```{r}
  # Min-Max Scaling
  data$variable_min_max <- (data$variable - min(data$variable)) / (max(data$variable) - min(data$variable))
  ```
- **Z-Score Standardization**: Scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  ```{r}
  # Z-Score Standardization
  data$variable_Z <- scale(data$variable)
  ```
- **Log Transformation**: Transforms skewed data to a more normal distribution.
  ```{r}
  # Log Transformation
  data$variable_log <- log(data$variable + 1)
  ```
- **VSN Transformation**: Normalizes data using variance stabilizing normalization.
  ```{r}
  # VSN Transformation
  library(vsn)
  data$variable_vsn <- vsn::vsn2(data$variable)
  ```

## Step 5: Detailed Data Exploration

Dive deeper into the data to uncover patterns and relationships:  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine correlations between numerical variables.
  ```{r}
  # Correlation matrix
  cor(data[, sapply(data, is.numeric)])
  
  # Scatterplot for visual correlation
  ggplot(data, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) + geom_point()
  ```
- **Cross-Tabulation**: Explore relationships between categorical variables.
  ```{r}
  # Cross-tabulation
  table(data$category1, data$category2)
  ```
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Use scatterplots, heatmaps, and other advanced visualizations to explore relationships.
  ```{r}
  # Heatmap
  library(reshape2)
  data_melt <- melt(cor(data[, sapply(data, is.numeric)]))
  ggplot(data_melt, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) + geom_tile()
  ```
- **Trends**: Identify trends over time or across categories.
  ```{r}
  # Line plot for trends over time
  ggplot(data, aes(x = time, y = variable)) + geom_line()
  ```
- **Clusters**: Identify clusters or groups within the data.
  ```{r}
  # K-means clustering
  set.seed(123)
  clusters <- kmeans(data[, sapply(data, is.numeric)], centers = 3)
  data$cluster <- as.factor(clusters$cluster)
  
  # Scatterplot with clusters
  ggplot(data, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2, color = cluster)) + geom_point()
  ```

## Step 6: Formulate Hypotheses

Based on your exploration, formulate hypotheses about the data:  
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Develop hypotheses that can be tested with further analysis.  
- **Preliminary Insights**: Summarize preliminary insights and observations.

## Next Steps

Conclude the EDA process when you have a good understanding of the data:  
- **Sufficient Exploration**: Ensure that you have sufficiently explored the data and addressed any anomalies.  
- **Clear Insights**: Make sure you have clear insights and hypotheses to guide further analysis.

After completing EDA, the next steps typically involve:  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Use statistical tests to validate your hypotheses.  
- **Model Building**: Develop predictive models based on the insights gained from EDA.  
- **Reporting**: Create detailed reports and presentations to communicate your findings.
